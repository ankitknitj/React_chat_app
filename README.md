# react-app-simple-chat-app

This is a simple chat application that employs React JS for the user interface, Node JS and Express JS for the backend, and stores data in MongoDB. It follows a component-oriented UI approach, with components written in JSX and ES6 style, bundled for production with Webpack 5. Babel transpiles JSX to JavaScript, and HTML5 and CSS3 are used for UI design. The application is responsive for both mobile and desktop use, and real-time communication is facilitated with Socket.io.
